  # mead's release builds are unsigned (no paid Apple Developer ID), so a
  # plain download would get Gatekeeper-quarantined and refuse to launch on
  # first open. Homebrew's own --no-quarantine flag for the official
  # homebrew-cask repo is being retired (see Homebrew/brew#20755) as part of
  # tightening what that repo accepts, but a third-party tap's own cask
  # definition isn't bound by that policy -- stripping the quarantine
  # attribute ourselves in postflight, on our own tap, achieves the same
  # practical outcome without depending on a flag Homebrew is removing.

    <<~EOS
      mead is pre-alpha software: expect bugs, and expect breaking changes
      between releases until it reaches a stable 1.0.
